    **Task:** Analyze the upcoming football match and provide a performance prediction.

    **Match:** {match_details['home']} vs {match_details['away']}

    **Statistical Model Probabilities:**
    - Home Win Probability: {model_probs['home']:.2%}
    - Draw Probability: {model_probs['draw']:.2%}
    - Away Win Probability: {model_probs['away']:.2%}

    **Instructions:**
    1.  Provide a brief, sharp analysis (2-3 sentences) explaining your primary prediction.
    2.  Consider factors like team form, key player news, and head-to-head records.
    3.  Conclude with a primary match outcome prediction (e.g., Home Win, Draw) and one or two alternative statistical predictions (e.g., Total Goals Over/Under 2.5, Both Teams to Score).
    4.  The entire response must be a single paragraph.

    **Example Response:**
    "Manchester City's dominant home form and Liverpool's defensive frailties suggest a high-scoring affair. With their main striker in prolific form, City are likely to control the game. Primary Prediction: Manchester City to Win. Alternatives: Over 2.5 Goals, Both Teams to Score."

    **Your Analysis:**
